# use-system-theme

React Hook for System Theme (User preferred color scheme). Please use React `> 16.8.0` for React Hooks support.

It detects the system theme and will update right after the users change the theme.

## Install

```bash
yarn add use-system-theme
```

or

```bash
npm install --save use-system-theme
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import useSystemTheme from 'use-system-theme'

export default () => {
  const systemTheme = useSystemTheme()
  return (
    <div>The System Theme is: {systemTheme}</div>
  )
}
```

## SSR support

To support SSR (server side rendering), the initial theme will be always `light` (since we don't know the theme on the server side) and it would immediately become `dark` if the device's theme is `dark`. Unfortunately, we can't avoid this because of the [React hydrate](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate):

> React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server and the client.

So that the initial screen is `light` and become `dark` immediately on dark theme devices is not a bug.
